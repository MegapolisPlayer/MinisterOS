# MinisterOS
a small OS by one person
------------------------------

This is my small journey (for learning, mostly) in the operating system development world.
I decided to just publish it to focus on more important things due to the difficulty of development.

CURRENT FEATURES:
-----------------
x86 BIOS bootloader

print function

reading hardware info (CPU, RAM)

time (from CMOS)

some math and string functions

----------------

Feel free to use any of the code (I myself copied a lot from the osdev wiki). For emulation it is recommended to use QEMU as VirtualBox (for some weird reason) doesn't support dark grey.

I also included a few shell script which do what they say - compile and run on both platforms.
