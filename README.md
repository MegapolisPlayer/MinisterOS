# MinisterOS
a small OS by one person
------------------------------

This is my small journey (for learning, mostly) in the operating system development world.
I decided to just publish it to focus on more important things due to the difficulty of development.

CURRENT FEATURES:
-----------------
x86 BIOS bootloader

print function

reading hardware info (CPU, RAM)

time (from CMOS)

some math and string functions

----------------

Feel free to use any of the code (I myself copied a lot from the osdev wiki). For emulation it is recommended to use QEMU or VirutalBox.
Originally, I thought that Vbox does not support dark grey, which I only later learned is due to it having a different VGA mode by default. (I'm not going to fix this though...)

I also included a few shell scripts which do what they say - compile and run on both platforms.
